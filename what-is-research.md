:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is research?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Define research in their own words.
- List reasons for conducting research.
- Explain the purpose and significance of research in various fields.
- Identify real-world examples of research in action.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

**True or False Questions**
1. All research must include an experiment in order to be valid. (False)

2. A key characteristic of research is that it follows a systematic and structured process. (True)

3. Opinions and assumptions can be considered research if they are strongly believed by many people. (False)

4. Academic research always leads to the discovery of new information. (False â€“ sometimes it confirms existing knowledge.)

**Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**

Which of the following is NOT a reason for conducting research?
 a) To satisfy personal curiosity.
 b) To improve decision-making.
 c) To confirm pre-existing biases.
 d) To solve real-world problems.
 
**Scenario-Based Activity**
- Imagine a university wants to understand why students struggle with online learning. 
    - How would you describe their study as research?
    - What benefits can research provide in addressing this issue?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
