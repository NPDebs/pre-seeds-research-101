:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

1. What are the strengths and limitations of the different types of research?
2. How can understanding these differences guide the design of better studies?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify at least two strengths and limitations for each of the types of research.
- Match each type of research to a practical example or disciplinary use case.
- Decide which research type(s) may be most appropriate for a given research question or real-world scenario.

## Think Like a Researcher

Imagine your university is considering launching a mental health app for students. 
You're part of the team evaluating its impact. What’s the best way to approach the task?

Would you:
- Measure students’ stress levels before and after using the app?
- Interview students to understand how they feel about using it?
- Compare the app to others in use at different schools?
- Or do a little bit of everything?

The way you choose to investigate the problem depends on the kind of research you conduct—and each type brings its own strengths and tradeoffs. 
In this lesson, we’ll explore those strengths, limitations, and the contexts where each approach thrives.

## A Quick Recap

In the previous episode, we introduced four common **types of research**, often grouped by purpose:

| Type           | Goal                                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Baic           | Expand fundamental knowledge without immediate use|
| Applied        | Address real-world problems directly |
| Descriptive    | Document or quantify what is happening |
| Experimental   | Test cause-and-effect relationships |
| Qualitative    | Understand experiences, meanings, context |
| Quantitative	 | Measure variables using numerical data |

These types can work independently or in combination, depending on the research question.

Let’s now take a deeper look at each research type and how it plays out in practice.

## Basic Research

**Used when:**  You want to understand how things work at a fundamental level.

### Strengths
- Builds foundational knowledge and theories.
- Often leads to future innovation and discovery.

### Limitations
- May not have immediate application.
- Hard to justify in applied or results-driven environments.
- Results tend to be tentative and may not lead to actionable conclusions on their own.

### Real-World Applications
- Studying how memory is encoded in the brain.
- Investigating the basic principles of quantum computing.

**Common Methods:**  Literature reviews, theoretical modeling, laboratory experiments.

---

## Applied Research

**Used when:** The goal is to solve a specific, practical problem.

### Strengths
- Results are actionable and directly relevant to practice or policy.
- Often interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different fields.
- Supports innovation and impact.

### Limitations
- May be constrained by political, commercial, or time pressures.
- Can prioritize short-term fixes over long-term understanding.
- Results may not always be published or widely disseminated.

### Real-World Applications
- A hospital testing a new nurse scheduling algorithm to reduce staff burnout.
- A city evaluating traffic sensors to improve road safety.

**Common Methods:** Case studies, evaluations, needs assessments, feasibility studies.

---

## Descriptive Research

**Used when:** You want to document or quantify what is currently happening.

### Strengths
- Helps build a foundational understanding of populations or phenomena.
- Supports policy-making and planning with concrete data.
- Often large-scale and generalizable.

### Limitations
- Does not explore causes or explanations.
- Can be misleading if poorly designed or biased in data collection.

### Real-World Applications
- A national census on employment trends across industries.
- A school district tracking student attendance and engagement.

**Common Methods:** Observational studies, cross-sectional surveys, routine data audits.

---

## Experimental (Causal) Research

**Used when:** You want to test cause-and-effect relationships by manipulating variables.

### Strengths
- Provides strong evidence for causality
- Often highly systematic and replicable

### Limitations
- Can be complex and time-intensive.
- May require ethical safeguards, especially in experiments.
- Difficult to fully control variables in real-life settings.

### Real-World Applications
- A clinical trial testing whether a new vaccine reduces infection rates.
- A randomized controlled study on whether gamified lessons improve student retention.

**Common Methods:** Experiments, longitudinal studies, regression modeling.

---

## Quantitative Research

**Used when:** You want to measure variables and test hypotheses using numbers.

### Strengths
- Enables statistical analysis and generalization.
- Suits large-scale studies and trend analysis

### Limitations
- May overlook context or nuance.
- Can miss "why" behind the numbers

### Real-World Applications

- Measuring the number of app logins and correlating with mood scores.
- Calculating percentage change in academic performance

**Common Methods:** Surveys, experiments, correlational studies

---

## Qualitative Research

**Used when:** You want to understand how people make sense of their experiences.

### Strengths
- Offers rich, contextual, in-depth insights.
- Flexible and adaptive to new findings.

### Limitations
- Findings are harder to generalize.
- Can be time-intensive to collect and analyze

### Real-World Applications
- Interviewing students about mental health stigma.
- Analyzing social media posts related to stress

**Common Methods:** Interviews, focus groups, ethnography, content analysis

---

## When One Type Isn't Enough

In the real world, many studies span multiple research types. Consider the case of the university’s mental health app:

- **Basic:** Understanding psychological mechanisms behind stress
- **Applied:** Designing and implementing the app
- **Descriptive:** Tracking usage rates and stress reports
- **Experimental:** Testing impact on mental health through a controlled study
- **Quantitative:** Measuring shifts in mood using survey scales
- **Qualitative:** Interviewing users about their experiences

This is where **mixed methods** come in—combining qualitative depth with quantitative breadth for a fuller picture.

## Cross-Disciplinary Lens

Different academic and professional fields tend to favor different types of research based on their goals:

| Discipline     | Typical Research Type | Sample Topic |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Public Health  | Applied, Qualitative, Descriptive            | Are health interventions reaching target populations? |
| Education      | Descriptive, Qualitative            | What do students report as barriers to learning? |
| Engineering    | Applied, Experimental                | How efficient is a new solar energy prototype? |
| Psychology      | Basic, Experimental, Quantitative            | What are the cognitive effects of screen time? |
| Sociology      | Qualitative             | How do young people define identity in online spaces? |

Understanding the types of research favored in a field can help you collaborate more effectively, apply for grants, and interpret findings with nuance.

## Test Your Knowledge!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge: Match the Type

**Scenario:** A local government wants to understand whether its free school meal program improves student performance.

Which research types could apply?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

- **Experimental:** Randomly assign some schools to receive the meal program and others not to, then compare performance outcomes between the two groups.
- **Applied:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the current program and offer policy recommendations on whether it should be expanded or revised.
- **Descriptive:** Collect data on how many students are receiving meals.
- **Quantitative:**  Conduct interviews or focus groups with students, parents, and teachers to explore how the meal program affects learning, focus, and well-being.
- **Qualitative:** Evaluate whether the program should be expanded based on findings.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Each type of research—basic, applied, descriptive, experimental, qualitative, and quantitative—has unique strengths and limitations.
- Complex problems benefit from mixed methods that draw on multiple types.
- Being intentional about research type improves clarity, coherence, and usefulness of findings.
- Different disciplines apply research types in different ways, tailored to their questions and practices.
