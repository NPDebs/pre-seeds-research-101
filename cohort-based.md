# Pre-openseeds Course

## The Why

[OLS](http://we-are-ols.org/) strives toward a future where research is open, diverse, and inclusive. So far, we've made significant strides through our cohort-based programs, aimed at empowering researchers to apply Open Science principles in their work.

However, a concern is that we meet researchers at a certain stage in their careers. This begs the question: **‚ÄúWhat is the plan for those who haven‚Äôt quite found their footing?‚Äù**

This question weighs more on us, especially considering the barriers faced by individuals from underrepresented groups. We recognize the need for support and encouragement at earlier stages in their journeys.

Hence, we propose a new initiative: a beginner course designed to equip aspiring researchers with the knowledge, skills, and tools to embark on their journey. This course will serve as a stepping stone, preparing individuals for the more advanced concepts covered in our flagship programs like [Open Seeds](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) and [Nebula](https://we-are-ols.org/nebula).

The goal of this program is to non-violently push individuals to a point where they feel confident and ready to work openly. Perhaps, this is a way to broaden our reach and do greater good.
