:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

1. What makes research different from everyday opinions?
2. What does it mean for research to be "replicable"?
3. Give an example of applied vs. exploratory research.
4. Why is critical thinking important in research?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Define research in their own words, and how it stands apart from other ways of knowing (e.g. opinion, belief, or anecdote)
- Identify the defining features (characteristics) of credible research.
- List reasons for conducting research, and the importance of research in various contexts.
- Identify real-world examples of research in action.

## A Wise Researcher Once Said…

_“Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict, and control the observed phenomenon. It involves inductive and deductive methods.”_
 — Earl Robert Babbie, American Sociologist

Let’s break that down. “Systematic inquiry” means we don’t just ask questions and hope for the best. 
We follow a **method**, apply **logic**, and rely on **evidence**.

## What Is Research, Really?
Research is the engine behind most of the advancements we see in medicine, technology, social policy, and even the arts.

At its core, **research is a structured way of asking and answering questions about the world**. It’s how we move from guessing to knowing.

Unlike casual observations or personal beliefs, research depends on:
- Gathering data
- Organising and analysing it
- Interpreting it logically
- Drawing conclusions that others can test or build upon

## Key Characteristics of Research
Let’s look at what separates research from, say, a viral tweet or a hunch you have about something:

1. **Systematic Approach**
Research follows a clear plan or methodology. You don’t jump from question to conclusion—you walk through the steps carefully.

2. **Objective and Unbiased**
Good research minimizes personal opinions or preferences. It focuses on what the data says, not what we want it to say.


3. **Empirical Evidence**
It uses real-world observations—things we can see, measure, or document—not just ideas or feelings.

4. **Replicability**
Someone else, following the same steps, should be able to reproduce your results (or at least understand how you got them).

5. **Critical Thinking**
Researchers must ask tough questions of their own work and be open to alternative interpretations.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge: Think Like a Researcher

Imagine you're sitting in a university lecture hall. 
Every time you glance around, more students seem to be glued to their phones. 
Some are scrolling through social media, others texting, and a few seem genuinely disengaged from the class.

You start to wonder:
_Why is this happening? Is it boredom, habit, or maybe something deeper about how students are taught today?_

Now pause—what if you wanted to understand this behavior, not just guess at it?
How would you systematically investigate this problem in a way that produces useful insights?

Hold on to that question. By the end of this lesson, you’ll know how a researcher would approach it.

## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
