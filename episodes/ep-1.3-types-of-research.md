title: "Episode 1.3: How is Research Classified?"
teaching: 12
exercises: 4

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

1. Why do researchers use different classification systems to describe their studies?  
2. Can a single study belong to more than one research category?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

Learners will be able to:

- List at least four common criteria used to classify research (e.g. purpose, methodology, design, timeframe).  
- Explain how each criterion influences study design and interpretation.  
- Match a brief study description to two appropriate classification labels.  

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

## Why Classify Research at All?

Imagine you and your classmates are each investigating students’ phone use during lectures.  
One of you runs an experiment, another conducts interviews, and a third mines university log-data.  
Even though you share a topic, **you are not doing the same *kind* of research**.

Giving studies the right labels helps us:

- choose *methods* that fit our goals,  
- communicate findings precisely, and  
- compare work across disciplines.

In this episode, we step back to see the *whole* classification map before zooming in on specific types in later lessons.

## The Big Picture: Common Ways to Classify Research

| Classification Criterion | Typical Labels (examples) | Key Question Answered |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Basic / Applied           | *Why* is the study being done? |
| **Methodology**          | Quantitative / Qualitative / Mixed | *What kind of data* will be collected? |
| **Research Design**      | Descriptive / Correlational / Experimental | *How* will the data be gathered and analysed? |
| **Goal (Depth of Study)**| Exploratory / Descriptive / Explanatory / Evaluative | *To what end* will the findings be used? |
| **Focus**                | Theoretical / Empirical   | Does the work build concepts or test them in the real world? |
| **Timeframe**            | Cross-sectional / Longitudinal | *When* and *how long* will observations occur? |
| **Data Source**          | Primary / Secondary       | Are you collecting new data or analysing existing material? |

> **Note:** A single project can legitimately wear *several* labels.  
> For instance, a *longitudinal applied mixed-methods evaluative* study is perfectly possible.

## A Closer Look at Our Categories

### 1&nbsp;—&nbsp;Purpose  
- **Basic** research asks fundamental “how or why” questions (e.g. *How does attention work?*).  
- **Applied** research seeks direct solutions (e.g. *Will locking phone pouches improve grades?*).

### 2&nbsp;—&nbsp;Methodology  
- **Quantitative**: counts phone glances per lecture.  
- **Qualitative**: interviews students about distraction.  
- **Mixed**: does both to get numbers **and** narratives.

### 3&nbsp;—&nbsp;Design  
- **Descriptive**: records *what* happens.  
- **Correlational**: checks if phone use relates to low marks.  
- **Experimental**: randomly assigns half the class to “no-phone” rules.

*(We will unpack each design in Episodes 1.4 and 1.5.)*

### 4&nbsp;—&nbsp;Goal  
- **Exploratory** work might map *new* distraction patterns.  
- **Explanatory** work tests whether boredom *causes* phone use.

### 5&nbsp;—&nbsp;Focus  
- A **theoretical** paper could model digital distraction behaviour;  
- while an **empirical** study would test that model in real lectures.

### 6&nbsp;—&nbsp;Timeframe  
- **Cross-sectional**: a one-off survey this semester.  
- **Longitudinal**: tracking the same cohort for four years.

### 7&nbsp;—&nbsp;Data Source  
- **Primary**: your own classroom observations.  
- **Secondary**: institutional attendance records from past years.

## Test Your Knowledge!
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge 1   
A research team videotapes every lecture of a single course for one term and counts phone-checking events each week.  
Which two classification labels (from different criteria) fit best?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Possible answer: *Applied* (purpose) and *Longitudinal* (timeframe).  
Another reasonable combination is Quantitative and Descriptive.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Challenge 2   
True | False: A study can never be both basic **and** applied.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

False. A project can develop basic theory in its early phase and apply that knowledge in a later phase—or run both threads in parallel.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Research can be classified by **purpose, methodology, design, goal, focus, timeframe,** and **data source**.  
- These labels guide methodological choices and clarify how findings should be interpreted.  
- Most real studies blend several categories; classifications are tools, not rigid boxes.  
- Recognising the map of research types prepares you to plan and communicate your own projects.

### Instructor Notes

- Invite learners to label their personal project ideas using at least three different criteria.  
- Emphasise that labels may shift as a study evolves—research is iterative.
