## A Wise Researcher Once Said...

_"Experienced researchers loop back and forth, move forward a step or two 
before going back in order to move ahead again, change directions,
all the while anticipating stages not yet begun. And no matter how carefully you plan,
research follows a crooked path, taking unexpected turns, sometimes up blind alleys,
even looping back on itself."_
— Wayne C. Booth (The Craft of Research)


## What is the Research Process?

The research process is a systematic journey of asking questions, gathering evidence,
analysing information, and sharing insights. Whether you're investigating a public health challenge
or evaluating the impact of a new product, or even assessing how frequently you drink water,
the research process provides a structured path to ensure that your conclusions are credible,
relevant, and reproducible.
But don’t be fooled by neat diagrams that suggest a rigid step-by-step path. 
In practice, the research process is more like a loop than a ladder. Ideas evolve, 
questions sharpen, methods shift, and results can take us back to the drawing board. 
And that’s not a failure—**that’s research done right!**.


## Why Learn the Research Process?

Imagine starting a long journey without a map or GPS. You might wander around and eventually 
find your way—but it’ll take longer, cost more, and you might end up somewhere you didn’t intend.

The research process is your map. It helps you:

- Stay organised
- Ask sharper questions
- Design stronger studies
- Avoid common pitfalls
- Work ethically and transparently

It also builds your credibility as a researcher, whether you’re publishing in a journal,
advising decision-makers, or giving yourself a pat on the back for staying hydrated.


## An Overview of the Key Stages

We’ll cover each of these in detail in later modules of the course, but for now, here’s the big picture:

*Aisha, a market woman and community volunteer in a rural town, begins to notice that many children in her 
area frequently miss school due to malaria. Concerned about the possible link between environmental factors 
and malaria cases, she decides to investigate whether improper waste disposal and stagnant water around homes
contribute to the high incidence of malaria among school-aged children.*


### Identifying a Problem or Question
Define and articulate the research question or problem that you want to investigate.
What issue do you want to explore? This step often emerges from curiosity, observations, literature reviews, or real-world challenges.

- *Aisha defines her research problem: “Does poor environmental sanitation contribute to the frequency of malaria infections
       among school-aged children in her community?” Her goal is to uncover patterns that could inform local health actions.*


### Reviewing the Literature
Conduct a thorough review of existing literature to understand what has already been studied
and published on your topic. What have others already discovered? What gaps remain?
Reviewing existing research ensures you’re building on a solid foundation and not reinventing the wheel.

- *She asks a local teacher to help her access some online articles and health brochures. From these, she learns that malaria
     is linked to stagnant water, uncovered containers, and poor drainage. She also speaks with a health worker to understand how
     similar studies have been done elsewhere.*


### Formulating Objectives or Hypotheses 
Develop a clear and testable hypothesis or hypotheses based on your research question
and literature review. These are your study’s compass. Objectives guide the focus; hypotheses offer testable predictions.

- *Aisha's hypothesises: “Children living in households with poor environmental sanitation are more likely to suffer repeated episodes 
    of malaria than those in cleaner environments.” This simple, clear hypothesis helps her structure her inquiry.*


### Choosing a Research Design 
Determine the research design and methodology, including selecting participants (sampling),
data collection methods (e.g., surveys, experiments), and procedures. Will you conduct experiments,
surveys, case studies, or secondary data analysis? This step aligns your tools with your goals.

- *She chooses a simple observational survey. She plans to assess environmental conditions around households and collect
   information on malaria history from parents of school-aged children. She creates a basic checklist with help from a
   local nurse, including signs of poor sanitation like stagnant   water, open drains, and exposed refuse.*

  
### Data Collection
Time to gather information! Collect empirical data based on your chosen methodology. This could be through interviews,
questionnaires, sensors, or even scraping online data. How you collect data must be ethical, accurate, and purposeful.

- *Over two weeks, Aisha visits 50 homes. She observes the environment and asks parents how often their children have
  had malaria in the past 6 months. She records her findings using her notebook and a checklist, with permission from participants.*


### Data Analysis
Use appropriate statistical or qualitative analysis techniques to analyse the collected data and test your hypotheses.
This is where your raw data becomes meaningful. You’ll look for patterns, test hypotheses, and answer your research questions.

- *With help from her nephew, who is good with Excel, Aisha organises the data. They create simple charts comparing the
  number of malaria episodes with the sanitation scores. The results suggest that children in homes with poor sanitation had
  significantly more malaria episodes.*


### Interpreting Results
Interpret the results of your data analysis in the context of your research question and hypotheses. Consider implications,
limitations, and future research directions. What do your findings actually mean? Are they consistent with previous research?
Do they raise new questions?

- *Aisha interprets the findings: in her community, poor sanitation practices appear strongly linked to repeated malaria
   infections. She notes that many families lack access to covered bins, drainage systems, or insecticide-treated nets.*

  
### Draw Conclusions
Draw conclusions based on your findings and discuss how they contribute to the field of study or address the research problem.

- *She concludes that community-wide sanitation improvements could reduce malaria infections. She emphasises the need for
  proper waste disposal, draining of stagnant water, and health education on malaria prevention.*

### Sharing Findings
Your research isn’t complete until it’s communicated. This could be through papers, presentations, infographics, or conversations
with stakeholders.

- *Aisha presents her findings at the monthly community meeting. She uses simple language and posters to explain the link
  between the environment and health. The town chief and local health workers are impressed and agree to help with a community clean-up drive.*


### Evaluate and Reflect
Reflect on the entire research process, evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, and consider areas for improvement or further exploration.

- *Aisha reflects that although she is not a professional researcher, her local knowledge and passion made the study meaningful.
  She notes that involving others from the beginning would have improved data accuracy and plans to train some youth to help with future
  community surveys.*

## The Process is Connected, Not Compartmentalised

Each stage flows into the next, and each decision you make affects those that follow. For example:

- Poorly defined objectives can lead to unclear analysis.

- Weak data collection methods can ruin great research designs.


That’s why this course doesn’t just teach techniques. We’ll emphasise **how everything connects**—because research isn’t just about *what* you do,
but *why* and *how* you do it.


## Research is Iterative (And That’s a Good Thing!)

You might design a perfect study on paper… only to find that your participants misunderstood your survey,
or your data has gaps, or your findings raise a brand-new (and even more exciting) question.

That’s not a problem—it’s progress.

Research often involves:

- Revisiting your question after early data collection

- Refining your analysis plan mid-study

- Updating your literature review when new studies emerge


In short: **you don’t have to get it all right on the first try.** 
But you do need a process that helps you notice when something needs to change—and gives you the tools to adjust.


## What’s Next?

In the rest of the course, we’ll take a closer look at each of the stages you’ve just seen. And for the rest of this introductory module, you’ll learn:

- The various types of Research and their applications
  
- The strengths and limitations of each type
  
But for now, remember this:
**The research process is your ally, not your obstacle.**
It’s flexible, responsive, and deeply logical—once you understand how it works. Let’s explore it together.

![You belong in The Carpentries!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries/logo/master/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

Callout sections can highlight information.

They are sometimes used to emphasise particularly important points
but are also used in some lessons to present "asides": 
content that is not central to the narrative of the lesson,
e.g. by providing the answer to a commonly-asked question.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
