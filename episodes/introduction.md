## Introduction

Welcome! ðŸŽ‰

Weâ€™re so glad youâ€™re here. This courseâ€”**Pre-seeds (Research 101)**â€”is not your typical introduction to research. It's built for you: the curious, the hopeful, the hands-on learners who may not always see themselves in traditional research spaces but know they have something to contribute.

Whether you're stepping into research for the first time or circling back with fresh eyes, you're in the right place.  

This isnâ€™t about throwing jargon at you or expecting you to "catch up." 
Weâ€™ll take things step by step, building confidence and skills in a way thatâ€™s practical, inclusive, and deeply human. 
Expect check-ins, relatable examples, and thoughtful pausesâ€”not just facts.

We believe research is for everyone, and that includes you!

This intro is intentionally lightweightâ€”donâ€™t rush through it! 
Invite learners to reflect on their own relationship with research and learning. 
Consider pausing to ask why they joined the course or what theyâ€™re hoping to walk away with.
